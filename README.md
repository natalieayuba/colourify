## About Colourify

Colourify is a serverless React app that uses the Spotify Web API to get the user's top tracks and groups them by albums, then generates a colour scheme for each of the top five album covers. Inspired by [Receiptify](https://github.com/michellexliu/receiptify), [Spotify Profile](https://github.com/bchiang7/spotify-profile), and [Spotify Serverless Auth](https://github.com/JonoMacC/serverless-spotify-auth).

Built with:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Color Thief](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
